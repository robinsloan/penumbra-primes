# Penumbra Primes

This repository contains the results of an odd prime number game.

Here's how it works:

As a player, you are invited to supply a prime number of your choosing. Then, if I'm crowning N winners, I review the entries and identify the N lowest unique primes.

So, if you pick 2 but seven other people pick 2: sorry. If you pick 3 and no one else picks 3: you win! If you pick 4... don't pick 4. It's not prime!

I love this game because there's a bit of math, a bit of psychology -- maybe even game theory -- and then a large preponderance of luck.

The included CSV file is organized like this: `prime`,`count`
